		<p>Community and youth development go hand in hand: a community only prospers when its young people prosper, and young people only flourish in a flourishing community. <br>
	At the John W. Gardner Center (JGC) at Stanford University, we partner with local communities to support their efforts to continually renew themselves, 
	by way of developing well-rounded young people who are successful—intellectually, emotionally, physically and socially—and who in turn are motivated to contribute to their communities, 
	both as leaders and as responsible participants.</p>
